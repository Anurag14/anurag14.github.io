title: "The essence of duality - from the perspecpetive of linear programming"

Primal dual relationships are often the heart of ideas in optimization and in applications of linear algebra. From advanced lagrangian duals to linear programming methods - all of them draw inspiration from the simple idea of duality.

Often the idea is quite misunderstood. The underlying simplicity is marred by complex notation and rigor. You are likely to get introduced to primal dual relationship in linear programming as following in most of textbooks.

There is a more condensed representation of the above for using linear algebra and matrix notation. However, it still doesnt throw any insight into the workings and motivation behind the primal and dual relationshiip.

However, I after giving the primal and dual relationship in linear programming a self read I decided to take a bite at explaining it.
