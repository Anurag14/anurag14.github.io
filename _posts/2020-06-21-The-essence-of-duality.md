Primal dual relationships are often the heart of ideas in optimization and in applications of linear algebra. From advanced lagrangian duals to linear programming methods - all of them draw inspiration from the simple idea of duality.

Often the idea is quite misunderstood. However, I after giving the primal and dual relationship in linear programming a self read I decided to take a bite at explaining it.
