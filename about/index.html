			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>
			As an individual, I have a bug that ideas can change the world. Nothing thrills me more than to be surrounded by people driven by that objective. 
			I strongly believe that Computer Science is the tool using which we can see those ideas come to life. 
			I have knack for programming and love researching new ideas. My main interests include Machine Learing and Theoritical Computer Science.
			Alought, I have never had a chance to do research in theoritical computer science and maths. It has been my dream to be able to do so.
			I am taking slow and steady strides to pviot into that direction (chuckles!). What good it may serve? Maybe in building my own Quantum 
			Computer to train machine learning algorithms since I never find GPUs. I dont shy away from esoteric.
			Lesser the people are doing something the better because that is where the human effort is required. To tread paths never treaded.
			I recently started writing technical articles on my blog, so do have a look!
